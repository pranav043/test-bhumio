# test-bhumio

Project made for bhumio Assignment for Image Extraction.

## Note-
As the image content is handwritten + blurry, it would be very difficult to get perfect data. The results may be wrong with given code.

*A highly trained custom model would be needed to get better results, handwritten content would be impossible to get otherwise.


## Run Locally

To run the project locally, run below commands. You will get result in console itself for all 3 images.

To run custom image, add it inside images folder & add its name in array in `index.js`

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/pranav043/test-bhumio.git
```

```bash
  cd test-bhumio
```

```bash
  npm install
```

```bash
  npm start
```
